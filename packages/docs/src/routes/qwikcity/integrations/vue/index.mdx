# Qwik Vue ⚛️

QwikVue allows you to use React components in Qwik, including the whole ecosystem of component libraries, such as [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [Threejs](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [React Spring](https://react-spring.io/).

## Installation

Inside your Qwik app run:

```shell
npm run qwik add vue
```

If you don't have a Qwik app yet, then you need to [create one first](../../../docs/getting-started/index.mdx), then, follow the instructions and run the command add React to your app.

```shell
npm create qwik
cd to-my-app
npm run qwik add vue
```

## Usage

Happy hacking!
