# Qwik Vue ⚛️

QwikVue allows you to use Vue components in Qwik, including the whole ecosystem of component libraries.

## Installation

Inside your Qwik app run:

```shell
npm run qwik add vue
```

If you don't have a Qwik app yet, then you need to [create one first](../../../docs/getting-started/index.mdx), then, follow the instructions and run the command add Vue to your app.

```shell
npm create qwik
cd to-my-app
npm run qwik add vue
```

## Usage

Happy hacking!
